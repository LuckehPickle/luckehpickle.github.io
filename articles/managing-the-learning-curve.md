- Speaking as someone that recently overcame the learning curve of Rust, it's
  not as big as it looks, but no one can deny its existence.
- Keep your eyes on the beauty of Rust, and what makes this learning process
  worth your time and effort.
  - Incredible performance.
  - A fantastic tooling ecosystem.
    - <https://rustup.rs> -> toolchain installer
    - `rustc` An excellent compiler that gives you real, actionable error messages.
    - Cargo a package manager, a build tool, a documentation builder, and test runner.
    - If you keep looking, you'll also find a task runner (`cargo-make`), a code
      formatter (`rustfmt`), and a static code analysis tool (`clippy`).
  - Some fantastic design decisions.
    - Powerful enums and pattern matching
    - No sneaky null reference exceptions.
