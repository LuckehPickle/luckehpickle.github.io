Back in 2017, Mozilla made a game changing announcement about the future of
Firefox. Their browser had been rebuilt from the ground up, resulting in
something faster, sleeker, and far more elegant that we'd seen before. They
called it [Firefox Quantum][1]. Quantum was the first browser to ever pull me
away from Chrome, and with it came a world of difference. This article explores
some of the amazing features that still keep me in love with Firefox today.

# DOM-Aware Screenshots

The screenshot tool in Firefox is unparalleled.

- Screenshot a specific DOM element. Great for when you've been slaving away on
  a particular front-end feature and you'd like to share your progress with your
  boss/colleague/friend.
- Screenshot the entire page.
- Screenshot a region.

Then, once you've actually selected what you would like to be included within
the screenshot, you can then either copy the screenshot to your clipboard or
download it to your device. That's a huge win for all those times you just want
to paste the image directly into an email or a Slack channel.
