It's December of 2018, and the new year is fast approaching. It's about this
time of year that many people start planning their new year's resolutions, but
it's a different story for designers. We start planning a facelift for our
websites.

It's been almost twelve months since I released *seanbailey.io* to the world.
And within that time my skills as a designer (and as a developer) have advanced
further than I could have imagined. It's about time that my website exhibited
that.

## Milestones

2018 was a colossal year for me. I hit some major goals, worked harder than ever
before, and (in no particular order) hit the following milestones:

 * I successfully completed Hacktoberfest 2018.
 * I scored three major commissions.
 * I accepted a 12-week summer internship as a software developer at Komatsu.
 * I was offered a full-time position at a design firm.

With these milestones in mind, seanbailey.io served me well. It showcased my
work, provided potential clients with some information about me, and it proudly
displayed my contact details.

But there is room for improvement. There always is.


## What didn't work as planned?

There inevitably comes a time in every retrospective, that you look back on the
things that didn't work out as well as you'd hoped. For me, there is one glaring
pain point. The website doesn't *feel* designed. It feels cobbled together, and
that's probably because it was.

I never designed the previous website. I just threw things together until I
found something that I liked. But I never truly reached that sweet spot that
you get with a deliberate, concentrated attempt at design.
