  <h1 class="has-eyebrow">Comet</h1>
  <p>Comet was my final year Major Design Project (MDP). I successfully designed
  and developed an instant messaging service, with the goal of being a privacy
  focused alternative to Facebook messenger.</p>

  <p>The project contained a lot of <i>firsts</i> for me. It was my first time
  designing a logo, designing an interface, and building a website with backend.
  The end product was ultimately not high enough quality to release to the
  world, but Comet proved to be a fantastic experience none-the-less.</p>
